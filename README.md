If we need to buy something, first of all we go to the shop. There are many different shops where you can buy w
hatever you want - from food to screws, bolts and nuts. It is not difficult to guess what type of store is the most popular.
It may be said without exaggeration that these types of shops are supermarkets and grocery stores. A human being eats every day, so passing by such shops is a rather difficult thing.
In every city you will find such shops as grocery stores, clothing stores, bakeries, butcheries. 
I love going to the flower shop most of all because flowers are my passion. Every week I go to an antique (curiosity) shop, because
I really enjoy the original, ancient things. From time to time I visit the toy store in order to buy toys for my nephews and children. Almost every month 
I go to the gift shop so that I can buy gifts on birthday for my family and friends.
I like to spend my time on shopping, preferably I like the self-service shops. You can scrutinize something as long as you like. 
A nagging seller does not hurry you, you are your own master. After it all, you can calmly go to
the cashier, where all purchases will be counted and added up. In our time, itâ€™s not only supermarkets that work in such a way, but also department stores, clothing shops and household goods shops.
